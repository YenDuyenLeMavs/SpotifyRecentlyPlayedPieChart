Curious about how often you replay songs on Spotify? Generate a pie chart of your recently played songs using Flask, Matplotlib, and Spotipy (a Python library).

You will need to log into your Spotify account, then create an app through the Spotify Developers website. You can then acquire the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET that you need to pass into the .env file. You also need to set your redirect_uri in your app through the Spotify Developers website. This project is currently using http://localhost:8888/callback as the redirect_uri.
